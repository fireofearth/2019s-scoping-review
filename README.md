# 2019S Scoping Review

## Protocol	

Scoping review on numerical methods / scientific computing software 	
Goal is to record / observe software development

## Search strategies	

The list of scientific computation software is obtained from multiple sources, mainly from Github, since there is no systematic way to obtain such a list.

1) Github search bar.
    + Skip: lecture material, book, resources, discussions, course material, examples
    + <https://github.com/search>

2) Github search bar with `language:[language of choice]` passed in.
    + Example: <https://github.com/search?q=ode+language%3Apython>

3) Github topics.
    + Skip: lecture material, book, resources, discussions, course material, examples	
    + <https://github.com/topics>

4) GNU software package.
    + List: <https://www.gnu.org/software>
    + List: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_GNU_packages#Scientific_software>	

5) Language specific package indices
    + Python package index <https://pypi.org>
    + Anaconda / conda-forge package index <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/repo>

6) Github lists. Some users maintain a list of software in Github repositories.
    + List: <https://github.com/nschloe/awesome-scientific-computing>

7) Individual software well known by the software research community.
    + Commons Math (Java) mentioned in Reid paper	
    + Sundials (C++)

8) math kernel / header only library
    + Most are only basic math and linear algebra so not relevant to our interests

When a relevant software is found I also view the repo owner page. Owners often maintain similar software to my interests.

To simplify search I selected only languages commonly used in math for searches: Java, C, C++, Fortran, Jullia, Matlab, Octave, R, Python.

### Crawler for Software Search

Half of software search was automated using the `crawler` script. The crawler script reads a `in.csv` file as input. Each row contains an `[owner slug]` in first column and `[repo slug]` as the second column. The crawler then access `https://api.github.com/repo/[owner slug]/[repo slug]`. In order to use the script you need to provide auth tokens to Github API when performing queries. See the code `crawler` for details.

- Some numerical figures were retrieved by HTML crawling the repo. page using Cheerio.
    + Library <https://cheerio.js.org/>

- Basic Github data was retrieved from the Github REST API (v3), a JSON response API queried using AJAX library Axios.
    + API entrypoint <https://api.github.com>
    + Github REST API (v3) documentation <https://developer.github.com/v3/>
    + Library <https://github.com/axios/axios>

- Source code details is obtained using a bash script `cloc-git` that clones every repository in the `in.csv` file, and then runs `cloc` on it.
    + Library <https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc>

## Issues

To evaluate the relevance of the software repository for our study of numerical bugs I looked for issues relating to numerical converge, iterations, etc. In the worst case scenario I looked at issues of marginal relation such as runtime object state management and floating point errors.

**Bug category**:

| field                  | description                                             |
|:-----------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------|
| software engineering   | bug not particularly related to numerical algorithm but to memory, type assignment, data types, etc |
| floating pt arithmetic | bug relating to management of floating point numbers including overflow, floating point precision, etc. Software engineering bugs on floating point data will be categorized as floating point unless data is clearly hardcoded i.e. zero |
| convergence            | bug relating to solution verification of numerical algorithm such as convergence, error, discretization, iterative steps |
| state management       | some solvers in OO language use states or observer classes so I am categorizing bugs relating to them here |
| not a bug              | devs concluded that property of code is improperly flagged as a bug |
| documentation          | user found an issue with software documentation (including code comments) |
| unrelated (not used)   | bug not about scientific computing software (i.e. UI, compatibility with operating systems) |

**Issue my description**: additional tags:

| BUGFIX   | what devs did to fix the bug                            |
| COMMENT  | any useful comments/conversations the devs made in the issues tracker |

### Crawler for Commits and Issues Search

I began writing an automation script to retrieve Github issues and commits details from repositories. The script is unfinished as of now. I might finish this so I have a GraphQL prototype for my other projects.
